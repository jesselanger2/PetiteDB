/** Specifies the public API for the Page implementation by requiring all
 * Page implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A Page represents the main-memory region used to hold the contents of a
 * block, and thus is used by the FileMgr in tandem with a BlockId.
 * Conceptually, the "main-memory" region is a sequence of bytes, into which
 * clients can insert values, and from which it can read values.
 *
 * A Page can hold any of the following value TYPES: ints, doubles, booleans,
 * strings, and "blobs" (i.e., arbitrary arrays of bytes).  At the Page API
 * abstraction, a client can store a value at any offset of the page but
 * remains responsible for knowing what values have been stored where.  The
 * result of trying to retrieve a value from the wrong offset is undefined.
 *
 * I prefer to not constrain implementation!  That said: your implementation
 * must follow the design for storing values of a given type (fixed-length
 * versus variable-length) as discussed in lecture and MUST BE FOLLOWED in your
 * implementation (see the Javadoc on maxLength() below).  Your implementation
 * MUST use exactly Integer.BYTES to store an int, Double.BYTES to store a
 * double, and 1 byte to store a boolean.
 *
 * Design note: a value MAY NOT be persisted across blocks!  Implication: the
 * length of a value's persisted bytes (obviously) cannot exceed block size nor
 * can the "offset + length of a value's persisted bytes" exceed block size.
 * Any attempt to "set" or "get" a value whose semantics imply "setting" or
 * "getting" a value that exceeds a single block size MUST RESULT in an
 * IllegalArgumentException.
