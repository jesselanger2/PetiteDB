 * created during system startup.
 *
 * Design note: it is recommended, but not required, for the TxMgr to delegate
 * all read/write function of its files to the lower-level "managers" supplied in the constructor.

     *
     * On DBMS startup, the TxMgr is responsible for TRANSPARENTLY rolling back
     * transactions that (per log record state) were neither committed or rolled
     * back when the DBMS last closed down.  Per lecture and textbook, the

     * visible when the DBMS finished the recovery process and is "open for
     * business".
     *
     * If the TxMgr implementation is in ANY way dependent on knowledge of
     * whether or not the DBMS is in "startup" mode, it MUST access the
     * DBConfiguration singleton to determine if implementation specific actions
     * must be taken to (re)initialize the necessary state.
