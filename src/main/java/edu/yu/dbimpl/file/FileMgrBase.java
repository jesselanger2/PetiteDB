/** Specifies the public API for the FileMgr implementation by requiring all
 * FileMgr implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * The file module as a whole is the lowest file in the PetiteDB stack.  It
 * enables higher-levels of the system to view the database as a collection of
 * blocks on disk, where all blocks contain the same number of (API-specified)
 * blocks.  The file module contains methods for random-access reading and
 * writing of blocks.
 *
 * The FileMgr always reads/writes/appends a block-sized number of bytes
 * from/to a file.  The FileMgr ensures that all file operations take place at
 * a block boundary, and ensures that each call to read/write/append incurs
 * exactly one disk access per call.
 *
 * The FileMgr class handles the actual interaction with the OS's file
 * system. Its constructor takes two arguments: a File specifying the root
 * directory of the database and an integer denoting the size of every database
 * block.  The root directory must be created relative to the directory from
 * which the JVM was invoked.  See e.g., https://stackoverflow.com/a/15954821
 * for the difference between user's directory and the current working
 * directory.
 *
 * Clients are forbidden for accessing the file system rooted in the directory
 * supplied to the FileMgr constructor EXCEPT as mediated by a PetiteDB API.
 *
 * Design note: the FileMgr creates files "on demand".  Specifically, if the
 * client invokes an API that references a file, and the file doesn't yet
 * exist, the FileMgr creates a new empty file with that name.
 *
 * Your implementation will likely invoke JDK methods that throw checked
 * exceptions.  As you can see, the API doesn't declare any checked exception:
 * you should catch and rethrow any such exception as a RuntimeException.
 *
 * The DBMS has exactly one FileMgr object (singleton pattern), which is
 * (conceptually) created during system startup, and in practice by a single
 * invocation of the constructor.
 *
 * Relevant lectures: intro-project and file_module
