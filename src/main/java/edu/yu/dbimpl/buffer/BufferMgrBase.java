/** Specifies the public API for the BufferMgr implementation by requiring all
 * BufferMgr implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A BufferMgr manages a constrained set of main-memory buffer pages by pinning
 * and unpinning the association of buffers to specific disk blocks.  Unless
 * explictly directed via a client invocation of flushAll(), movement from
 * main-memory to disk is (at best) translucent to clients.  Implementations
 * are REQUIRED to ONLY move from main-memory to disk if necessary (as defined
 * in lecture).
 *
 * The DBMS has exactly one BufferMgr instance (singleton pattern), which is
 * created during system startup.
 *
 * Design note: it is recommended, but not required, for the buffer manager to
 * delegate all read/write function of its files to the file manager.
