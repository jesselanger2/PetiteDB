package edu.yu.dbimpl.metadata;

/** Specifies the public API for the TableMgr implementation by requiring all
 * TableMgr implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * TableMgrBase constrains the TableMgr design by implicitly assuming an
 * implementation consisting of one table that stores meta-data about table
 * names, and another tables that stores meta-data about field names.  Also:
 * the names of these tables and some of their field names are constrained to
 * match the specified public constants.  In general, PetiteDB tries to give
 * implementations more freedom, but hard to see how to define a testable
 * interface that doesn't use e.g., Java's reflection APIs to do the job.
 *
 * A TableMgr stores the meta-data about tables created by users, thus creating
 * and managing a catalog.  Implementations MUST SUPPORT client ability to
 * TableScan iterate over the TABLE_META_DATA_TABLE and FIELD_META_DATA_TABLE
 * catalog tables.  The TABLE_META_DATA_TABLE MUST STORE table name information
 * in a TABLE_NAME field.  Implementations NEED NOT support field names and
 * tables names that are larger than MAX_LENGTH_PER_NAME.
 *
 * The DBMS has exactly one TableMgr object (singleton pattern), which is
 * (conceptually) created during system startup, and in practice by a single
 * invocation of the constructor.
