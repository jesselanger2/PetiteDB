/** Specifies the public API for the IndexMgr implementation by requiring all
 * IndexMgr implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * An IndexMgr manages and persists index meta-data (allowing clients to create
 * and retrieve such meta-data).  An IndexMgr also instantiates corresponding
 * index "runtime index" instances, allowing clients to iterate over an index's
 * records and access the corresponding data records.
 *
 * The DBMS has exactly one IndexMgr object (singleton pattern), which is
 * (conceptually) created during system startup, and in practice by a single
 * invocation of the constructor.
 *
 * Note to implementors: while not adequate for production deployments,
 * worst-case linear performance for these APIs is sufficient.
