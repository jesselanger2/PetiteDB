/** Specifies the public API for the LogMgr implementation by requiring all
 * LogMgr implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * The DBMS has exactly one LogMgr instance (singleton pattern), which is
 * created during system startup.
 *
 * The LogMgr is responsible for writing log records into its log file. (The
 * log file isn't exposed to any database client, and its data is accessible
 * only via the log file iterator()).  A LogMgr is responsible for writing and
 * returning log records but has no knowledge of the structure of these
 * records: as far as its concerned, it persists "a sequence of bytes".
 *
 * A LogMgr is free to persist additional meta-data to the block as long as it
 * only returns the client's bytes to the client.  However, for reasonably
 * sized blocks and log records, it's unreasonable to throw an
 * IllegalArgumentException because the meta-data causes log records to exceed
 * the size of a block.  In other words: efficiency counts, or at least
 * "excessive inefficiency" will cost you.
 *
 * When the database is started for the first time, the LogMgr
 * latest-sequence-number (LSN) MUST be initialized (to facilitate my testing)
 * to 0.  A successful call to append() returns the current LSN to the client
 * and then increments the value.  For subsequent instantiations of the
 * database, the LogMgr latest-sequence-number MUST be initialized to the
 * latest LSN value of the previously instantiated DBMS.  Similarly, all
 * previously persisted log records must be available to the LogMgr upon
 * database reinstantiation.
 *
 * Design note: it is recommended, but not required, for the log manager to
 * delegate all read/write function of its log file to the file manager.

     * the iterator, and is needed to support transaction recovery.  At this
     * level of the module hierarchy, you do NOT need to understand why such
     * iteration is necessary: focus on providing this function.
     *
     * Design note: given that log iteration is done on startup by the recovery

     * the first record in the log file (log iteration proceeds from latest
     * record to earliest record), otherwise returns true.  The next() method
